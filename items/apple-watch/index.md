	<h1>Apple Watch</h1>
	<p class="lead">A connected smartwatch that still functions as a quick glanceable timepiece and health tracker.</p>

	<h2>Why I can't leave home without it</h2>
	<p>It gives me notifications at a glance, tracks workouts and sleep, and can even act as a phone in emergencies. It combines convenience with utility in a compact package.</p>
