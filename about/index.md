# About My Everyday Carry

Everyone has essential items they carry daily. These tools and gadgets become an extension of who we are and how we interact with the world. This small site showcases three items I won't leave home without.

## My Three Essentials

- [**Apple Watch**](/items/apple-watch/) — Keeps me on schedule, tracks health, and stays connected without being distracting. A perfect balance of utility and simplicity.

- [**Slim Wallet**](/items/wallet/) — Just the essentials: a few cards and some cash. No bulk, no extras, just what I need for daily transactions.

- [**iPhone**](/items/iphone/) — My mobile command center. From communication to navigation, photography to payments, it's the digital Swiss Army knife of my everyday carry.

## What Makes a Good EDC?

A thoughtful everyday carry setup should be:

- **Purposeful** — Each item serves a clear function
- **Reliable** — It works when you need it
- **Minimal** — Only what you truly need
- **Personal** — Reflects your specific needs and style
